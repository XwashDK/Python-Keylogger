cmd and enter then type python Keylogger.py and enter then it will run and then minimize the keylogger cmd window
to stop the keylogger close the cmd window



At the time the keylogger was made the developer use the 3.10.6 Version of Python and the 3.10 on Microsoft Store
But that can be changed if its not work on newer verison use the version the developer uses we think that will fix it



The keylogger is a non virus one so it will not be detected by antivirus



But dont use it to illegal things just use it for fun prank you friends
or something if it will be used to illegal things we dont want to apologise for it just so you know
